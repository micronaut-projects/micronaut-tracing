This section will document breaking changes that may happen during milestone or release candidate releases, as well as major releases eg (1.x.x â†’ 2.x.x).

== Micronaut Tracing 4.5.0 breaking changes

In version `1.19.0` of OpenTelemetry annotations have moved from `io.opentelemetry.extension.annotations` to `io.opentelemetry.instrumentation.annotations`. If you want to continue to use them, you have to update package name.

== Micronaut Tracing 5.0.0-M2 breaking changes

The Micronaut Tracing Zipkin module (`io.micronaut.tracing:micronaut-tracing-zipkin`) has been renamed and separated in two new modules:

- Micronaut Tracing Brave (`io.micronaut.tracing:micronaut-tracing-brave`)
- Micronaut Tracing Brave HTTP (`io.micronaut.tracing:micronaut-tracing-brave-http`)

if you are using OpenTracing and Micronaut Tracing Zipkin module, you have to change `io.micronaut.tracing:micronaut-tracing-zipkin` dependency to `io.micronaut.tracing:micronaut-tracing-brave-http`. The Micronaut Tracing Brave HTTP brings HTTP filters for auto instrumentation of your requests. If you don't need HTTP filters you can only add `io.micronaut.tracing:micronaut-tracing-brave` dependency.
