The pkg:tracing.opentelemetry.processing[] package contains transformers and mappers that enables usage of Open Telemetry annotations.

To enable Open telemetry annotations you have to add next annotation processor in your dependency block:
dependency:micronaut-tracing-opentelemetry-annotation[scope="annotationProcessor", version="{version}", groupId="io.micronaut.tracing"]

The Open Tracing annotations that are defined inside the pkg:tracing.annotation[] package are also available for usage inside Open Telemetry.
