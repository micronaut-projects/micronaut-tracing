== ID Generator

Some custom vendor may require the span traceId in different format from the default one. You can provide your own bean of type https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/blob/main/sdk/trace/src/main/java/io/opentelemetry/sdk/trace/IdGenerator.java[IdGenerator].
For an example, AWS X-Ray requires a specific format for their tracing identifiers. Add the following dependency, to register an instance of https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/blob/main/sdk-extensions/aws/src/main/java/io/opentelemetry/sdk/extension/aws/trace/AwsXrayIdGenerator.java[AwsXrayIdGenerator] as a bean of type https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/blob/main/sdk/trace/src/main/java/io/opentelemetry/sdk/trace/IdGenerator.java[IdGenerator].

dependency:opentelemetry-aws-xray[scope="implementation", groupId="io.opentelemetry.contrib"]

To successfully export traces to the AWS X-Ray you have to run https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector[AWS Open Telemetry Collector] that will periodically send traces to the AWS.
