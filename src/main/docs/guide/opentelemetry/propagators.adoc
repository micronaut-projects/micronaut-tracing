In your project you can specify propagators that you want to use. The default one is set to "tracecontext, baggage". The available values are defined on the https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/blob/main/sdk-extensions/autoconfigure/README.md[Open Telemetry Autoconfigure SDK documentation].

To use https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-concepts.html#xray-concepts-tracingheader[AWS X-Ray] propagator inside your application you have to add next dependency in your project:

dependency:opentelemetry-extension-aws[scope="implementation", groupId="io.opentelemetry"]

And the "xray" has to be added inside configuration file.
